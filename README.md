  ## About Me 👋🏻
  
 Hi, I’m Victor, a technology enthusiast who loves turning ideas into creative and functional projects. Since the age of 14, I’ve been exploring the world of game development, always looking to learn something new and create unique experiences.

Currently, I’m also diving into web development, expanding my skills and exploring ways to combine different programming areas. To me, programming is an incredible way to bring ideas to life, merging creativity and technical expertise.

 ##  My Technological Approach 🖥️

My journey in game development is marked by a passion for creating interactive and immersive experiences. I have solid experience in UI integration, developing intuitive interfaces that are not only functional but also enhance the player’s experience.

In the multiplayer world, I use Photon to integrate network features and create games with robust multiplayer support, always seeking better performance and user experience.

I’m passionate about creating engaging and challenging core gameplay mechanics, working from movement design to system balancing and interaction in games. I have experience with different game engines, with Unity and Unreal Engine being my main tools to bring vast worlds and unique gameplay to life.

Every project is an opportunity to learn something new, and I’m always in search of improving my skills to create increasingly innovative and impactful games.
